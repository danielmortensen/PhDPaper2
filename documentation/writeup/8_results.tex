\section{Results\label{sec:results}}
\subsection{Setup}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Describe baseline scenario
	\item Describe experiment setup
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{comparison with baseline and prior work} 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item show bar plot that compares the financial results of He, baseline, and the current algorithm.
	\item show plot that shows the power vs time for the alg. and baseline
	\item show plot that shows the breakdown of uncontrolled load w/ the baseline and alg.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Benefits with increased numbers of buses}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item show plot of cost as buses increase
	\item show comparison plot that displays the power use of the 15 bus 1 charger scenario for both the baseline and algorithm and show how it keeps cost down for large bus scenarios.
\end{enumerate}
	
TODO: include blurb in the beginning that talks about how the current discrete method lacks precision with large step size and is computationally difficult with small ones.
